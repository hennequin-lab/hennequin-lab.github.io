    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <br>
    <div class="text-justify"><p>The generation of motor patterns has been the focus of several recent
experimental studies. Recordings have shown that populations of neurons in
motor cortex transition into a preparatory state while a movement is being
planned, and engage in transient collective dynamics of large amplitude during
its execution. We investigate this phenomenon in rate models of cortical
dynamics. Weakly coupled networks cannot produce the substantial transient
departure from background activity observed in the experiments. Strongly
coupled random networks with their inherent chaotic dynamics, on the other
hand, do not capture the transient nature of movement-related activity. Here we
introduce a new class of models with strong and complex excitatory recurrence,
and inhibitory feedback of matching complexity to stabilize the dynamics. We
show that such inhibition-stabilized networks transiently amplify certain
network states. The network activity can be forced to arrive at one of those
states by the end of the preparatory period through the delivery of an
appropriate external input. Upon a go-signal, the input is withdrawn and the
network is released to elicit transient single-neuron and collective dynamics
that match the data well. In particular, we reproduce the recently uncovered
phenomenon of rotational dynamics during the execution of movement [Churchland
et al (2012)]. Additionally, muscle activity may be read out from these noisy
transients to produce complex movements. Surprisingly, inhibition-stabilized
circuits connect several previously disparate aspects of balanced cortical
dynamics. The mechanism that underlies the generation of large transients here
is a more general form of &ldquo;balanced amplification&rdquo; [Murphy and Miller (2009)],
which was previously discovered in the context of visual cortical dynamics.
Furthermore, during spontaneous activity in inhibition-stabilized networks, a
detailed balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to single cell exists that
is much finer than expected from shared population fluctuations.</p>
