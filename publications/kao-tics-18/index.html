<hr />

<p>This is a commentary article on <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36774">Hennig et al., eLife
(2018)</a>.</p>

<p>Even the simplest of behaviours require concerted interactions among thousands
of neurons.  Of these many neurons, however, only a fraction directly determine
behavioural outputs.  For example, reaching for a cup of coffee can potentially
be achieved by a myriad of different activity patterns in primary motor cortex
(M1): as long as corticospinal (or “output-potent”) neurons produce the correct
activity, the activity of other (“output-null”) neurons appears entirely
unconstrained, or “redundant”. Redundancy has attracted much attention lately
due to its potential significance for robust and flexible neural computations.
Redundant representations improve robustness to perturbations [1,2], might
allow multiple computations to occur concurrently in the same circuit [3,4],
and could explain why behaviour remains stable despite routine reorganization
of neural representations [5].</p>

<p>Importantly, neural redundancy could also hold important information concerning
the circuit implementation of motor control.  Indeed, although output-null
activity does not <em>directly</em> contribute to behaviour, it is likely an essential
cog in the mechanism that produces correct output-potent activity.  Recently,
<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36774">Hennig et al.</a> used a brain-computer
interface (BCI) as a scientific tool to uncover the principles by which the
brain chooses one pattern of output-null activity over another [6].
In monkeys, they recorded the activity of ~100 M1 neurons, used it as a control
signal to actuate a cursor moving on a screen, and trained the animals to
perform specific cursor movements.  Critically, this BCI setup allowed the
authors to choose which linear combinations of the recorded neurons&rsquo; action
potentials mattered for the cursor velocity, and which did not.  In other
words, they could arbitrarily create “output-potent” and “output-null”
directions in the state space of neural activity, as illustrated in
Figure 1A.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1 &ndash; Neural redundancy in M1 suggests a new view of M1 as a controlled dynamical system.</strong>
<strong>(A)</strong> Illustration of neural redundancy: the same behaviour (natural, or
BCI-driven) could be produced by very different trajectories in the state space
of neural activity (three shown here). The activity along “potent” directions
is constrained by the desired behaviour, and is therefore the same for all
candidate trajectories (top right inset). In contrast, activity along “null”
directions has no direct effect on behaviour and is therefore free to vary (top
left inset).
<strong>(B)</strong> M1-as-a-controller view.
<b>(C )</b> M1-as-a-plant view.
<strong>(D)</strong> Illustration of the fixed-distribution hypothesis. At any time,
output-null activity is selected as if drawn from some fixed distribution of
neural activity (heat map), conditioned on a momentary desired value of potent
activity (white dot).
<strong>(E)</strong> A 2-unit neural network (top) is driven by optimal control inputs to
generate some desired fluctuations along a given potent direction.  The
distribution of network activity (dots) has the same structure irrespective of
the potent direction being used (compare orange and green).  The black ellipse
delineates the region of state space within which the network activity can be
steered given a fixed input energy budget.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36774">Hennig et al.</a> used activity recorded
during the BCI task to systematically rule out and rule in hypotheses regarding
the structure of output-null activity in M1.  A first possibility is that there
is no predictable structure: M1 might receive noisy or task-unrelated inputs
from other brain areas, and leave uncorrected these inputs&rsquo; contributions to
output-null activity.
<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36774">Hennig et al.</a> confronted two
variants of this hypothesis to their data, and found that neither accurately
predicted the distributions of activity along the output-null directions,
across various directions of cursor movement.</p>

<p>A second hypothesis is inspired by previous work in motor neuroscience, in
which M1 is typically viewed as controlling the dynamics of skeletal muscles
(the “plant”) using appropriate inputs (Figure 1B; [7-8]).  According to
well-established engineering wisdom, control inputs should ideally be kept
small (relative to some nominal value) to ensure robustness of the control
solution. Strictly speaking, this principle applies to potent activity only
(input to the muscular system). However, M1 might be implementing this
principle more liberally and constrain its activity to be as “small” overall as
the generation of correct potent activity permits.
<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36774">Hennig et al.</a> considered two
versions of this “minimal firing” hypothesis; again, neither made accurate
predictions.</p>

<p>Substantially better predictions of output-null activity were obtained based on
a third hypothesis seemingly unrelated to previous work in motor control. This
“fixed distribution hypothesis” postulates that M1 tends to produce patterns of
activity belonging to a fixed repertoire, which does not depend on the specific
choice of potent directions. Given a choice of potent directions, activity is
selected on a moment-by-moment basis from this fixed repertoire, on the
condition that it elicit the right cursor velocity.  Mathematically, this
corresponds to conditioning a fixed distribution of M1 activity on some desired
value of momentary potent activity (Figure 1D). Thus, if one knew the fixed
distribution, one could predict the structure of output-null activity for any
choice of potent/null directions.  To test this hypothesis,
<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36774">Hennig et al.</a> used activity recorded
for one set of potent directions as an empirical proxy for the (unknown) fixed
distribution, and used it to predict output-null activity under a second choice
of potent directions. Remarkably, these predictions were better than those of
any other hypothesis considered, and were as good as finite samples would
allow.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36774">Hennig et al.</a>&rsquo;s fixed
distribution hypothesis provides a compact, thought-provoking description of M1
activity, it lacks a computational rationale.  What normative principle would
account for the author&rsquo;s observations, and illuminate the role of M1 in motor
control?  Hints might be found in recent experimental [9] and theoretical [10]
work, in which M1&rsquo;s complex activity patterns are understood as resulting from
strong internal dynamics. Accordingly, beyond thinking of M1 as controlling
muscles (Figure 1B), one can view M1 as being part of the “plant”, i.e. an
extension of the muscles that too needs to be controlled (presumably via
control inputs from other brain areas; Figure 1C).  Under this new perspective,
the fixed distribution hypothesis emerges naturally.  We illustrate this using
a canonical model of cortical dynamics, with two coupled populations of
excitatory and inhibitory cells (Figure 1E).  Both populations receive inputs
optimized for the production of some desired activity fluctuations along a
chosen potent direction.  From a control theoretic standpoint, strong network
interactions imply that control inputs of fixed energy can steer activity
further along some “preferred directions” than along others, by exploiting the
network&rsquo;s tendency to produce correlated activity patterns.  Thus, if control
inputs to M1 are energy-limited (as they are in our example, and as robustness
demands), M1 activity under an optimal control policy should remain confined to
a certain repertoire, or ”fixed distribution” (Figure 1E, black ellipse).
Importantly, this repertoire is a reflection of the network&rsquo;s dynamics, and
does not depend on the specific choice of potent directions.  As expected,
therefore, the fixed distribution hypothesis accurately predicts the
statistical structure of output-null activity in this toy example.  In other
words, <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36774">Hennig et al.</a>&rsquo;s findings are
consistent with optimal control of M1 dynamics under energy constraints.</p>

<p>Going forward, we speculate that much will be learned about the neural basis of
movement by thinking of M1 (and spinal cord circuits) not only as body
controllers, but also as dynamical systems under the control of other neural
circuits.  This new perspective will suggest principled ways of elucidating the
role of motor areas upstream of M1 (e.g. thalamic nuclei, basal ganglia,
cerebellum). Examining neural redundancy at each level of the control
hierarchy, e.g. using BCI-inspired techniques, will continue to bring useful
insights: null ain&rsquo;t dull under the skull.</p>
